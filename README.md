# Rock-paper-scissors

The goal of this project is to build a simple Rock, paper, scissors game that has a simple UI made of 3 buttons and paragraphs that display the result, winner by round and overall winner (whoever reaches 5 points first).

I feel like I have learned a lot on this one, not just the how's but more importantly the why's. I learned how to think about problems better and how it all fits together.

Some of the things I learned:

- basic DOM manipulation and how to walk the DOM by using parent, child and sibling relationships, not just by using querySelector and querySelectorAll for everything
- eventListeners, how to attach them and how they work, what is the event object
- How to delay the alert() function so the score would update before the winner message is shown. It wasn't required for this project to show the winner in alert popup box but I thought it would be fun. When I realized that score is not getting updated before the message was shown I was intrigued to find a solution for that
